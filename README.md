## Why Next-GPT?

ChatGPT is indeed a powerful system, but it can provide a better user experience for some tasks. For example, when we want to perform a translation, we have to specify the target language each time and ask it to translate. However, with the Next-GPT Translate feature, you will feel like you are using a Google Translate and have a better translation.
